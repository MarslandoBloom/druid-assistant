## Allosaurus

The allosaurus is a predator possessing great size, strength, and speed. It can run down almost any prey over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with its wicked claws.

***Dinosaurs.*** Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

## Amphiptere

*A flight of gold-crested, bat-winged serpents bursts from the foliage.*

***Tiny Wyverns.*** An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger similar to a wyvern's at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.

***Swooping and Swift.*** They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.

***Strength in Flocks.*** Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.

## Death Butterfly Swarm

*Enormous clouds of orange and green butterflies add a reek of putrefaction to the air, stirred by the flapping of delicate wings.*

***Demon-Haunted.*** A death butterfly swarm results when a rare breed of carrion-eating butterfly, drawn en masse to the stench of decay, feeds on the corpse of a fiend, demon, or similar creature.

***Dizzying and Poisonous.*** The colorful, chaotic flapping of the insects' wings blinds and staggers those in its path, allowing the swarm to necrotize flesh from those it overruns. Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting, poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.

***Devour the Undead.*** Undead creatures are not immune to a death butterfly swarm's poison. A swarm can rot an undead creature's animating energies as easily as those of the living. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death butterfly swarm always attacks the undead, finding ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.

## Garroter Crab

*This blue-black freshwater crab scuttles through the mud by the stream, searching for prey.*

***Strangling Claws.*** Garroter crabs are named for their abnormal right claws, which have evolved over time to strangle prey like a barbed whip. This long whip-claw is lined with powerful muscles and joints at the beginning, middle, and end that give it great flexibility.

***Clacking Hordes.*** During mating season, thousands of garroter crabs congregate in remote riverbanks and marshes, and the males whip their shells with a loud clacking sound to attract mates. Familiar with the sound, locals avoid the rivers and streams near their homes during such times.

***Tasty Predators.*** Garroter crabs prey on rodents, cats, and other small animals caught by the riverbank. Considered a delicacy by many, fishing communities near colonies of garroter crabs often have a few skilled fishers capable of bringing in the dangerous crabs.

***Unknowing Diviners.*** Garroter crabs are touched by minor divination power that typically triggers when the crabs attack humanoids, though some humanoids have found ways to prepare the crabs' remains to create the same effect. Because of this peculiar ability, scholars speculate the crabs were created long ago as tools of divination or were gifted by some longforgotten deity of fate to its followers.

> ##### Garroter Crabs in Midgard
>
>Common to the Argent upriver from the Free City of Zobeck, garroter crabs are used by the Kariv and crab diviners in their divinations. The Kariv treat the crabs as sacred creatures and never eat them. However, local Zobeckers hold no such notions and find them quite delectable. Much larger garroter crabs exist, and the Kariv believe these incredibly rare crabs can be used to shape the future, as well as divine it.

## Gbahali

*This large reptile has dagger-like teeth and a scaly hide of shifting colors.*

***Chameleon Crocodiles.*** While distantly related to crocodiles, gbahali have adapted to life away from the water. To make up for the lack of cover, gbahali developed hides that shift to match their environments. Gbahali hide changes color to match its surroundings so perfectly that it becomes nearly invisible. Any lonely rock on the grassland might be a gbahali waiting along a trail, caravan route, or watering hole. Their thick hide can be made into hide or leather armor, and with the proper alchemical techniques it retains some of its color-shifting properties.

***Strong Hunters.*** Gbahalis are powerful predators, challenged only by rivals too large for a gbahali to take down or by predators that hunt in packs and prides, such as lions and gnolls. Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for many plains hunters.

***Sentries and Stragglers.*** In combat, a gbahali relies on its camouflaging hide to ambush prey. It may wait quietly for hours, but its speed and stealth mean it strikes quickly, especially against weak or solitary prey. Its onslaught is strong enough to scatter a herd and leave behind the slowest for the gbahali to bring down.

## Giant Ant

*Several pony-sized ants swarm around an ant the size of a draft horse, clacking their serrated mandibles and threatening with their stingers.*

Giant ants look much like a normal ant with six legs, a waspish segmented body, and large antenna. Their hides are covered in thick chitin, and they have large, serrated mandibles flanking their mouths and stingers on their tails. These stingers are the size of a shortsword, and they're capable of stabbing and poisoning a human to death.

***Colony Defenders.*** Giant ants form colonies under the control of a queen much like their normal-sized cousins. Sterile females form castes with the workers building the nest and caring for larvae. Queens and male drones rarely leave the colony. Soldiers defend the colony and forage for food.

***Carry Prey Home.*** Giant ants are both predators and scavengers, working in organized groups to bring down large prey and carry it back to the nest. Giant ants tend to ignore animals away from the colony when not foraging for food, but they quickly move to overwhelm prey when hungry or threatened. A giant ant stands nearly four feet tall and weighs 400 pounds, while a giant ant queen is over five feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. Giant ants communicate with each other primarily with pheromones but also use sound and touch.

## Giant Elk

The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.

## Giant Spider

To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.

The cloud of silt doesn't move with the glass gator.

## Glass Gator

*A near-transparent crocodilian creature leaps from the water, the remnants of its last meal still visible in its transparent gut.*

***Strange Anatomy.*** The body of a glass gator is most similar to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more distinct head. Once the glass gator gets hold of prey, it wraps its body around the victim and squeezes, like a constrictor snake. Unlike a serpent, however, which uses powerful muscles to crush and suffocate its prey, the glass gator is only trying to bring its underbelly into contact with the prey. The glass gator's belly is lined with hundreds of stingers that deliver a virulent nerve toxin.

***Transparency.*** The glass gator's transparency isn't total. Its digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most vulnerable just after eating, when it's lethargic.

***Larval Form.*** Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It's been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.

## Greater Death Butterfly Swarm

*Enormous clouds of orange and green butterflies add a reek of putrefaction to the air, stirred by the flapping of delicate wings.*

***Demon-Haunted.*** A death butterfly swarm results when a rare breed of carrion-eating butterfly, drawn en masse to the stench of decay, feeds on the corpse of a fiend, demon, or similar creature.

***Dizzying and Poisonous.*** The colorful, chaotic flapping of the insects' wings blinds and staggers those in its path, allowing the swarm to necrotize flesh from those it overruns. Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting, poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.

***Devour the Undead.*** Undead creatures are not immune to a death butterfly swarm's poison. A swarm can rot an undead creature's animating energies as easily as those of the living. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death butterfly swarm always attacks the undead, finding ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.

The web must be anchored between two solid mases or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A camouflaged web layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is camouflaged to match its surroundings, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them. Each creature that starts its turn in the camouflaged web or that enters it during the creature's turn must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to break the webbing and free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

>***Call Spiderlings (1/Day).*** The j'ba fofi releases pheromones and calls 1 swarm of spiders. The spiders arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the j'ba fofi and obeying its pheromone commands.

## J'ba Fofi Spider

*A large, brown spider that resembles a tarantula with exaggeratedly long legs gracefully emerges from the bushes, followed by similar arachnids that are smaller and yellow in color.*

The j'ba fofi resembles an oversized tarantula with very long legs, although a flicker of intelligence indicates this species evolved above mere vermin.

***Spider Pack Leaders.*** The youngest are yellow in color, but their hairs turn brown as they age. Immature j'ba fofi pull ordinary spiders into their fellowship in teeming masses that follow along wherever they roam.

***Fond of Camouflage.*** The natural coloring of a j'ba fofi, along with its habit to cover its hair-like bristles in a layer of leaves makes it virtually invisible in its natural environment. They weave leaves and other forest litter into their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.

## Kongamato

*This large pterodactyl has emergent feathers and a long, beaklike jaw.*

***Boat Breaker.*** The kongamato's name means "breaker of boats," and, as that implies, it delights in systematically destroying the small vessels of those who come too close to its perch. No one knows what motivates this form of attack, although some sages suppose that the kongamato mistakes canoes for large prey like hippopotamuses or crocodiles.

***Spoken in Whispers.*** For some tribes, kongamatos present a terrible threat, and the villagers speak only in whispers about them, fearing that mention of the beasts could attract their wrath. In some cases, evil priests and cultists summon these beasts as their servitors and use them to terrify villagers.

***Maneaters.*** Kongamatos that have eaten human flesh develop a preference for it. These maneaters perform nightly raids on small towns, snatching locals in their claws and flying away.

## Mbielu Dinosaur

*This lumbering saurian quadruped has large, oblong plates of bone covered in greenish slime protruding from its back and its thick, club-like tail.*

***Large Plates.*** People describe this reptilian herbivore as "the animal with planks growing out of its back." The mbielu is a large dinosaur akin to a stegosaurus, with square dorsal plates that support symbiotic colonies of toxic, green algae. The plates themselves are as large as shields.

***Aquatic Herbivore.*** An mbielu spends most of its life underwater, feeding on aquatic plants and avoiding the withering glare of the harsh sun, but it comes onto land frequently to sun itself for a few hours before immersing itself once again.

***Toxic Alchemy.*** Its dorsal plate algae undergo an alchemical reaction in the continual transition between water and sky, especially during mbielu migrations to new watery dens. The algae produce a hallucinogenic poison that clouds the minds of most creatures. Mbielus themselves are immune to the toxin.

## Ngobou Dinosaur

*This ill-tempered, six-horned creature resembles a triceratops the size of an ox, with pairs of horns atop its nose and brows, as well as great tusks jutting from each side of its mouth.*

***Hatred of Elephants.*** Ngobous are ox-sized dinosaurs often at war with elephants over territory. Ngobous are irascible and suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of elephant scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou's rage.

***Poor Beasts of War.*** Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on the ill-tempered animals. Most believe the ngobou's behavior is too erratic, especially if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.

***Trample Crops.*** Stampeding ngobou herds can smash fields of crops flat in minutes, and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or cattle in little time.

## Plainscow

The hulking plainscow is an exceptionally sturdy beast of burden native to the *Dividing Plains* and used by the people of central Tal'Dorei for centuries. Though many wild herds still roam the plains, domesticated plainscows are more common, used as mounts, pack animals, and livestock. Plainscows are unusually empathetic for beasts, and often bond with a rider for life. They stand 6 feet tall, weigh about two tons, and live for 70 years.

***Market Value.*** Plainscows can be bought in *Westruun* for 200 gp. A plainscow has a carrying capacity of 1,500 pounds.

## Pteranodon

These flying reptiles have wingspans of 15 to 20 feet and typically dive for small marine prey, though they are opportunists and will attack any creature that appears edible. A pteranodon has no teeth, instead using its sharp beak to stab prey too large to swallow with one gulp.

***Dinosaurs.*** Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

## Red-Banded Line Spider

*Bands of red swirl along the abdomen of this small, black spider.*

Red-banded line spiders are named for both the deep red swirls on their abdomens, unique to each spider, and for their peculiar hunting technique. The largest ones hunt in the dark canopy of temperate and subtropical forests.

***Hand-Sized Hunters.*** These furry, brown spiders are not enormous monsters, but they are big enough to be alarming. A typical one is as big as a human hand with fingers spread wide, but some grow as large as small dogs.

***Webbed Line.*** Line spiders don't spin webs but instead perch and watch for prey. When prey wanders near, the spider launches a line of webbing to snare it, then pounces unerringly along that line to deliver a deep bite. Their potent venom can incapacitate creatures much larger than themselves, and they quickly devour flesh with their powerful jaws.

***City Dwellers.*** Line spiders are often found in cities, and their size makes them a good replacement for a garroter crab in certain forms of divination. They're favorites among exotic pet dealers—usually with their venom sacs removed, sometimes not. Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably good pets if they're kept well-fed. If they get hungry, line spiders may devour other small pets or even their owners.

## Stirge

This horrid flying creature looks like a cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end in sharp pincers, and its long, needle-like proboscis slashes the air as it seeks its next meal.

Stirges feed on the blood of living creatures, attaching and draining them slowly. Although they pose little danger in small numbers, packs of stirges can be a formidable threat, reattaching as quickly as their weakening prey can pluck them off.

***Blood Drain.*** A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis into the flesh while using its pincer legs to latch on to the victim. Once the stirge has sated itself, it detaches and flies off to digest its meal.

With supernatural speed, the suturefly repeatedly pierces the target's face, each time threading a loop of the target's own skin through the previous hole. These skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly closed. If a target's mouth is sewn shut, it can't speak. If its mouth and nose are sewn shut, it can't breathe, and if both eyes are sewn shut, it is blinded. A creature, including the target, can take its action to cut open one of the sewn orifices by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity check with an edged weapon or tool.

## Suturefly

*This darting creature resembles a dragonfly, but with three pairs of gossamer wings and a body made from splintered wood. Flashes of bright colors run along its body.*

***Sew Mouths Shut.*** Forest folk rarely speak when sutureflies dart through the trees, because these creatures listen for lies and sew any offender's mouth, nose, and eyes shut. Some say the old woods hide nothing but liars, and that is why the deepest forest is shrouded in silence. Others say that the forest uses sutureflies to smother those who break its covenants or reveal its secrets. Adventurers see a suturefly's handiwork more often than they glimpse one of the creatures directly: corpses with mouths and noses stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious people whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.

***Seek Out Curses.*** Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black-banded sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies. When attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to surprise opponents. Once they sew someone's mouth closed, they target the same victim's nose, unless threatened by another opponent. Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents' mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they're destroyed.

> ##### Sutureflies in Midgard
>
>In the Mistwallows of the deep Margreve, a green and gold variety of suturefly attacks briar folk, hags, and any others who allow magic to escape their lips. Sutureflies dart, hover, and strafe with perfect maneuverability. Most are six inches long, but rangers who've ventured deep into the Margreve claim to have discovered detached suturefly wings over 5 feet long, likely from a creature capable of sewing shut the eyes and mouths of giants.
>
>Folk of the outer Margreve release sutureflies from wooden coffers at forest trials to encourage witnesses to tell the truth. In the heart of the woods, one of Baba Yaga's daughters polices her "flock" of stolen children with sutureflies.

## Swarm of Prismatic Beetles

*A dazzling explosion of multicolored lights erupts from this cloud of flying beetles, flashing every color of the rainbow.*

***Flesh-Eating Beauties.*** The depths of the jungle are filled with beautiful-but-lethal wildlife, and prismatic beetles are superlative examples of this. These flesh-eating, venomous insects distract and subdue their prey with sparkling beauty even as they devour it alive. Individual prismatic beetles sparkle like precious gems in the light. Tosculi traders, gnolls, and humans often incorporate their carapaces into decorative jewelry or use them as special components in enchantment and illusion spells and items.

***Hypno-Paralytic.*** When swarming in the thousands, these beautiful bugs create a hypnotic cascade of glimmering hues capable of enthralling creatures. As they descend on their dazed prey, the beetles' bites slowly paralyze their victims while their toxins distract the mind with feelings of euphoria and delight.

***Predator Partners.*** Although carnivorous, prismatic beetles are not overly aggressive; they attack other creatures only when hungry or threatened. Even when they're not attacking, however, they can be a threat. More than one unwary traveler has stopped to admire what they thought was a docile swarm of prismatic beetles and became captivated. The unfortunates are often killed and eaten by a lurking jungle predator, as such animals know the beetles can attract prey.

## Triceratops

One of the most aggressive of the herbivorous dinosaurs, a triceratops has a skull that flares out to form a protective plate of bone. With its great horns and formidable speed, a triceratops gores and tramples would-be predators to death.

***Dinosaurs.*** Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

## War Ostrich

*The large, flightless bird dove in and out of battle, screeching defiantly as its rider drove a spear into its foes.*

In the wild, war ostriches are dangerous and skittish, prone to lashing out with punishing kicks while sprinting around the battlefield. Humanoids in grasslands use them to create chaos by driving a flock of fast-moving war ostriches into a caravan or enemy troop formations.

***Faster than Horses.*** War ostriches have been domesticated for centuries. They are a fearsome sight on the field of combat when bearing warriors into battle. War ostriches are heavily employed in regions where horses are rare or impractical or where their leaping ability enables cavalry to charge over broken ground. Stubborn and willful, these creatures are difficult to train. Once trained though, they are loyal and fierce mounts, fighting to the death in battle alongside their riders.

> ##### War Ostriches in Midgard
>
>War ostriches are commonly found throughout the Southlands both as wild and domestic animals. The people of Nuria Natal, in particular, use war ostriches as beasts of burden and mounts along the River Nuria, switching to camels for long treks across the Crescent or Sarklan Deserts. Further south, gnolls and nkosi both hunt and domesticate war ostriches, and many warriors decorate their armor, clothing, or hair with the feathers of favored mounts who helped the warrior achieve greatness in battle.

## Young Spinosaurus Dinosaur

*This massive, blue-skinned saurian lumbers out of the river, depositing a platoon of armed lizardfolk on the bank before releasing a terrifying roar.*

***Friend to Lizardfolk.*** The spinosaurus is a special saurian bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care. As spinosauruses age slowly, most large lizardfolk tribes have several young spinosauruses and one adult spinosaurus in their care, reserving the massive adult for major engagements or when the entire tribe must move at once.

***Enormous Size and Color.*** This immense saurian has a long, tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running the length of its back. An adult spinosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, while a young spinosaurus is a mere 20 feet long, weighing 6,000 pounds or more.

***Swift Predator.*** A spinosaurus is at home on both land and water, chasing prey from one to the other when necessary. Though they are carnivores, they have an affinity for lizardfolk and other reptilian humanoids, eating such creatures only if the creatures horribly mistreat them or if they experience extreme starvation with such creatures as the only option for food.

> ##### Spinosauruses in the Southlands
>
>The lizardfolk of Veles-Sa in the Southlands use spinosauruses as a mode of transportation. The creatures are large enough to pull barges or to carry a crew of raiders anywhere on the rivers, and they are swift overland. Lizardfolk scouts are especially fond of these enormous reptiles, as they are powerful combatants and can carry a dozen lizardfolk warriors.
>
>In addition to their role as trained raiders in Veles-Sa, some spinosauruses live in or along most of the major river systems of the Southlands—including the River Nuria. There they are also called "river dragons" or sometimes "river walkers," and they are frequently associated with the worship of Baal-Hotep and Set. They are kept as sacred animals in several river temples, where they are fed regular meals and have been known to grow to enormous size and strength.
>
>Finally, along the Spice Coast, spinosauruses carry high-value spice cargoes along the coast when banditry is rife or when a lizardfolk mercenary company is available to guard materials going north toward Mhalmet, Nuria, or Ishadia. These Spice Coast beasts are often especially bred for gaudy coloration: green-andorange, blue‑and-gold, and even red-and-black bloodlines have been spotted in the Spice Coast harbors.
>

> ##### Spinosauruses as Mounts
>
>Spinosauruses mate each year in the winter. A male spinosaurus brings food and helps build an enormous nest of reeds, sticks, and mud. Then the male departs, leaving the female to lay and care for the eggs. Spinosaurus eggs are typically found in nests along riversides or deep in marshes. They are sometimes stolen and sold, generally to lizardfolk and sometimes to daring humans with a knack for training animals. These eggs are worth as much as 2,000 gp apiece; live young are worth twice that. Characters eager for spinosaurus mounts, however, should note that buying or domesticating such an enormous carnivore requires vast quantities of food and patience. They do not take easily to domestication.
>
>Before it can be ridden in combat, a spinosaurus must practice bearing the weight of its trainer and passengers. They rarely master more than a handful of tricks, but they are extremely comfortable in the water and can be trained to be are aware that some of their riders may not breathe water.
>
>An adult spinosaurus can carry up to six tons as cargo. Riding a spinosaurus requires an exotic saddle, riding platform, or howdah.

## Zanskaran Viper

*Greenish liquid drips from the dagger-length fangs of this monstrously large snake.*

***Human Hunters.*** This giant venomous snake is known as one of the most lethal serpents, and one of the few that will attack an adult human. One bite from the Zanskaran viper can kill a healthy human in seconds, and its tough hide makes it difficult to dispatch quickly.

***Jungle Bred.*** A Zanskaran viper grows quickly in its jungle home, and some even venture into the savannah to terrorize antelopes and young giraffes. A full-grown Zanskaran viper is up to 30 feet long and weighs up to 400 pounds.

***Famous but Rare Venom.*** A dose of its viscous green venom is known to fetch as much as 2,500 gp in some markets.
