# Changes Summary

As requested, the following changes have been made:

## 1. Dice Roller Improvements

The dice roller tab has been modified to make results more compact and ensure they fit within two columns without requiring scrolling:

- Kept the two-column layout in the `.dice-results` CSS class
- Removed the "Roll X:" prefix from all dice results
- Modified the display format of advantage/disadvantage rolls to use square brackets instead of parentheses
- Kept the column-span properties for the `.dice-grand-total` CSS class for proper display of totals

## 2. Dice Styling Updates

Modified the styling of dice results for better readability and focus:

- **Bold formatting is now only applied to:**
  - The final total of each roll
  - Natural 20s on d20 rolls
  - Natural 1s on d20 rolls
- Removed underlining from all results
- Green/red coloring still only applies to d20 rolls (natural 20s/1s)
- Regular roll values and advantage/disadvantage indicators are no longer bold
- Updated CSS to apply these styling rules consistently

## 3. Kept the "Manage Data" Button

The "Manage Data" button remains in the footer as originally designed, providing access to data management functionality.

## Files Changed

1. `css/style.css` - Updated styling for dice results (bold only for specific values, removed underlining)
2. `js/dice-roller.js` - Modified result display formatting

## Next Steps

To apply these changes to the bundled file:

1. Run the bundler using the provided script: `node bundle-script.js`
2. This will generate an updated `druid-assistant-bundle.html` file with all the changes

The updated files are ready for use, and the README_UPDATE.md file provides detailed instructions on how to run the bundler to create the final bundled HTML file.
